# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

* Memory Bank initialization for C++ Snake Game project
* Project architecture analysis and documentation
* Understanding existing codebase structure and dependencies

## Recent Changes

* 2025-05-31 12:52:02 - Memory Bank initialized with project context from README.md
* Identified project as extended Snake Game using SDL3 graphics library
* Documented core architecture components and build dependencies

## Open Questions/Issues

* What specific extensions were made to the original Snake Game starter code?
* Current state of game functionality and features
* Performance optimization opportunities
* Code quality and modern C++ best practices implementation
* Testing strategy and coverage

2025-05-31 12:52:02 - Initial active context established during Memory Bank setup.
## Architecture Analysis Complete

2025-05-31 12:53:31 - Comprehensive source code analysis finished

### Key Findings
* **Game Type**: Player vs Enemy chase game on 32x20 grid (1024x640 pixel resolution)
* **AI System**: Enemy uses AICentral for pathfinding and map awareness
* **Threading**: Asynchronous enemy movement using std::future
* **Incomplete Features**: Projectile system exists but not implemented
* **Performance**: 60 FPS target with proper frame timing

### Current Implementation Status
* ✅ Core game loop functional
* ✅ Player movement system
* ✅ Enemy AI integration
* ✅ SDL3 rendering pipeline
* ✅ Grid-based collision system
* ❌ Projectile functionality (placeholder only)
* ❌ Multiple enemies (commented out vector)
* ❌ Score calculation (returns 0)

### Technical Debt Identified
* Bug in Character::IsAlive(bool alive) - parameter shadows member
* AICentral TODO comments indicate incomplete pathfinding
* Hardcoded map dimensions (20x32) in AICentral
* Projectile Move() method empty implementation
