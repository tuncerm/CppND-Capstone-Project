# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

## Decision

* Memory Bank Architecture - Established comprehensive project documentation system
* Project Analysis Approach - Start with README.md and file structure before deep-diving into source code

## Rationale 

* Memory Bank provides persistent context across different modes and sessions
* Systematic approach ensures complete understanding before making recommendations
* Documentation-first strategy aligns with software engineering best practices

## Implementation Details

* Five core Memory Bank files created: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md
* Timestamp-based logging for all updates and changes
* Cross-mode accessibility for consistent project understanding

## Architecture Analysis Decisions

2025-05-31 12:53:50 - Source code analysis methodology and findings documented

### Decision: Comprehensive Header-First Analysis Approach
**Rationale**: Examined header files first to understand class interfaces and relationships before diving into implementation details
**Implementation**: Analyzed game.h, character.h, player.h, enemy.h, AICentral.h, gamemap.h, projectile.h, then key implementation files

### Decision: Focus on OOP Design Patterns and Modern C++ Usage
**Rationale**: Capstone project should demonstrate advanced C++ concepts and software engineering principles
**Implementation**: Documented inheritance hierarchy, smart pointer usage, async programming, and RAII patterns

### Decision: Identify Technical Debt and Improvement Opportunities
**Rationale**: Project appears to be work-in-progress with incomplete features and potential bugs
**Implementation**: Catalogued unimplemented features, identified bugs, and documented enhancement opportunities

### Key Architectural Findings
* **Strength**: Well-structured OOP hierarchy with proper inheritance
* **Strength**: Modern C++ features (smart pointers, async/futures, enum classes)
* **Weakness**: Incomplete feature implementation (projectiles, scoring)
* **Weakness**: Technical debt (parameter shadowing, hardcoded values)
